# Customer Feedback Management System

This project is a **Customer Feedback Management System** built using **FastAPI**. The system collects customer feedback and converts it into actionable "cards." Each card represents a potential problem or area for improvement. The cards can be analyzed to derive insights, prioritize actions, and improve customer satisfaction.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- **Database**: [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) (For simplicity, but you can replace it with PostgreSQL or MySQL)
- **Authentication**: [OAuth2 with Password Flow](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/oauth2-jwt/)
- **ORM**: [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
- **Testing**: [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pipenv** or **virtualenv** (optional but recommended for managing dependencies)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-feedback-management.git
   cd customer-feedback-management
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   Using `Pipenv`:

   ```bash
   pipenv shell
   ```

   Or using `virtualenv`:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

```env
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./feedback.db  # Update this if you use a different database
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
```

## Running the Application

### Start the FastAPI Server

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### API Documentation

FastAPI automatically generates API documentation. You can access it at:

- **Swagger UI**: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
- **ReDoc**: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc)
